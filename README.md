# AutoTwitSpaceDL
Automatic Twitter Space Downloader and Uploader with Discord integration

# What it does
- Will (Hopefully soon) Monitor a list of twitter users continously for twitter spaces
- Notify you via discord webhook
- Upload a temporary archive of the twitter space to transfer.sh so you can share it with friends

It's not the best, but I'm working to make it the best I can.

# TODO
- Also allow for the option to automatically create torrents and upload them to mogu.holopirates.moe in addition (or not) to the tempupload feature
- Allow for the Customization of the Author/Footer images and footer text
- Make a nice looking cli (Maybe)
